Hello! I'm Andy Castro and this is my praticle avaliation.

My choose was to develop the OnSign TV Temperature using ReactJS with Typescript.

I thought interesting to offer a better User Experience with a layout different from the proposed.

  - Dependencies added:
    - axios
    - react-spinners-kit
- Svg Icons: https://www.flaticon.com
- Font Overpass by Google: https://fonts.google.com/
- Code Editor: Visual Studio
- Code Pattern: Prettier
- OS: macOs

## Run Instructions

In the project directory, you can run:

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
